## Introduction

I believe in testing everything. But let's face it, sometimes that can be long and tedious (even for an automated test suite). There are a lot of apis that go into software applications. Software applications essentially exist as a means of transferring data from one place to another. And sometimes we want to only test the api (aside from the UI) to assure proper functionality. This could be in the form of a load test or a functional test.

This project demonstrates an example of both load and functional testing of an instance of IBM's aspera on cloud solution. Specifically its functionality to transfer large media files from one location to another on a server.

This is done using the Retrofit 2 libraries along with OkHttp3.
